## Chapter One: Trade Kills

A harvest moon hung in the sky, surrounded by it’s star companions. It illuminated the front of houses, then the houses casted sheadows into the backyards where insects hung in dark bushes, away from the dangerous predators that were humans. Behind them, over the fences was an alleyway. There stood a figure wearing a black cloak, a black T-shirt and black jeans. The outfit practically made him invisible in this alley. Not that anyone would have the vain to go in a dark alley at night, but just in case.

This man’s name was Sam Brookfield. He had just finished his serving time at Harper Prison for murder. He had been there 20 years. Some wanted him to stay longer, as he had ended someone's life. But to Sam’s delight, he got freedom again.
Only to murder more.
Nobody knew why he liked being evil. It bought him nothing except prison time. However, he did have a reason. His dad, Daniel Brookfield, was a criminal too. But after Dan was discovered smuggling a grenade into America, he was arrested. He passed away while in prison, and Sam wanted to finish what his father started.

And that's why he was here. To finish it off. A figure also wearing black clothes appeared from the shadows. She was Jenny Arthur, also known by many as Cheetah. She had no family that anyone knew of. There was rumour that she killed her family. She was here to trade with the other man called Sam. She spoke with a French accent. Her voice was deep and quiet. “You have it?” She asked.
“I've got it. Have you?” Sam questioned back.
“Yes. Let's get this over with.”

Sam gave his trade first. A handgun, small but effective. It was made from plastic. It would go through metal detectors without any alarms. It would be very useful for Jenny’s new plan concerning Italy. She could get it there easily. Sam then spoke; “Come on then!” He bellowed impatiently. Jenny dropped the hand-grenade into Sam’s palms. She shot off like a cheetah. Sam could see how she got her name. He stared at the object in his hands. He felt powerful.

And then he saw, to his horror, that the pin wasn't in the grenade. He tried to scream but nothing came. His face just drooped.
And then it blew...
Flames bursting out of a small but dangerous object. It was a loud explosion and it woke many up. Terrorists? They must have been scared of it, whatever it was. Especially when they looked outside and saw a giant ball of flame.

The smoke lifted into the air to reveal blood, and a body. Everyone saw who it was. Sam? Their greatest threat was dead and yet, they were still terrified- terrified that they had a new threat, stronger than Sam, worse than Sam. But it was dark and nobody would be found under the invisibility cloak of the night.

And, hearing the commotion, 12 year old Mikey Hiker was pulled from dreamland and awoke. He was a shorter boy, and had trouble reaching out to his bedside table for his glasses. He had blonde hair, cut short. He had perfectly hazel eyes, which he shoved his glasses on, then looked at his watch. It was a Tag, a present for his birthday, a month ago in January. He admired it so much, he actually slept in it. It told him that it was 01:24. He wondered why he had awoken, why there were shouts of both worry and happiness. He flung open his window to reveal the outside.

His fence was half burnt away, and people stood in his garden, looking into his alleyway. Mike smelt smoke hanging in the air. It was dark, and the many people didn't help, but through them he could make out a silent corpse, spread out on the floor. Had a fire taken him? Gunshot killed him? There were many questions and very few answers.

And Mike knew he would get answers if he went outside. Not many answers, but just enough that some puzzle pieces would be knocked together. His mum and dad weren't in, they were probably yelling at people for trespassing on their property. Mikey’s parents weren't very cheery people. His dad worked as a shopkeeper at Sainsbury’s. Mike heard people talking about his dad, Andy Hiker, and not good things. They called him the ’grumpy shopkeeper’ and Mikey had told no one that he was his dad. His mum, Jane Hiker, was a dentist. She hated the job, and she accidentally took her anger out on the children that came to get their teeth checked. They were quite a poor family, (they could have got more money if they were good at their jobs) and this bungalow was all they could afford.

But Mike loved his mum and dad, and his life. He may not have had all the latest technology, but he was grateful for a roof over his head, and for a mum and dad at that. He then realised that he would be the centre of attention if he went out in his Star Wars onesie. He dressed into a Nike SB top and joggers. He slipped on his coat and Converse and burst into his back garden. Like he had predicted, his mum and dad were shouting. But they stopped as soon as they saw their son.

“Mikey, what're you doing at this time of night?” Asked Jane.
“Somebody has died next to our backyard! I have reason to be awake.”
“You saw the body?”
“Only a bit of it from the window.”
“I wouldn't look at it as close as this.” It was Andy.
But curiosity took over Mikey, and he looked. It was something he would regret. Blood was pouring out of the man like a ferocious sea. Mikey turned away, feeling sick. He would never drink cranberry juice again. He ran into his house, up the stairs, into his bed and passed out.

Chapter Two: Project Erupt

Cheetah emerged through the door. She marched towards the table, the only object except from the chairs in this boring room. The room was painted dark grey, with no windows, and lights built into the walls. There were other people in there. In the organisation that liked to call themselves Predators, they had code names. The more plump one was called Scorpion, named so because of the incredibly painful sting he caused on people who didn't obey him. There was Arachnid, the oldest one, who always had revenge. Like a spider, he bit back- and harder.

Then the skinny one, called Werewolf. Just like the animal, he was angry and fierce, and was the best assassin in the room. The man next to him was a very small man. He had to stand up on his chair. He was Serpent. He could slither through tight spaces, and also had a venomous bite. Including Cheetah, they made up the secret organisation dubbed Predators.

Cheetah sat. “Stage one complete, Sam Brookfield dead, gun received.” She took it out of his pocket and held it up.
“Good that he's gone. He was about as unsuccessful as his father, that idiot Jaguar.” Arachnid stated.
“Sam could have joined us. He was...” Scorpion started.
Arachnid finished, “...Terrible! He got caught and put in prison as well. Father like son. Son like father. That's why we killed them both. Annoying we didn't kill Sam in prison. It could maybe have been the same as his father’s.”
Serpent applauded. “That was a good kill, Werewolf. People think Dan just passed away, maybe of age. That shooting-him-in-the-head-and-patching-it-up was genius.”
“Thanks, but how do you say that without passing out?” Werewolf, despite being evil, had a sense of humour still.
Arachnid, however, had a complete stone heart. “There's no time for your bad humour. We need to get Project Erupt rolling.”

A week had passed since the dead body incident. Nothing bad had happened. Mike was alright after passing out, he woke up nine hours later. The past few days had been normal. Just school days. But school had been worse. Ever since he got back to ....., Mike had been avoided, as if he had the plague. Most children seemed scared of him. Mikey had no idea why this was happening. On Friday he finally found out.

He had got to school and put everything in his locker. He was alone as he did so; even his best friend Thomas was keeping at least five metres away from him. He got to class and he was late, but he was given no C3, just told by a worried voice to sit at the back, where he was away from everybody else. So even the teacher was afraid of him. But he wouldn't know why until lunchtime.

So eventually, lunch came. It was a warm Winter day, but Mikey didn't feel warm. He had a shot at playing with Oliver Fuller, a boy in his class that could have been a new friend, but he looked up from his iPhone 8 and ran. Mike felt sorry for Oliver- that iPhone must have been expensive. Mike picked it up; maybe he could leave it by Oli’s locker. It was only then when he saw what it read: 


*BBC News: Tuesday, 7:30AM.*

*A 12 year old, named Mikey Hiker, according to some, supposedly is responsible for the death of Samuel Brookfield. Despite the odds of this, including the fact that it wouldn't be easy for a 12 year old boy to lay his hands on a bomb, there are chances that this theory may be true. For instance, many that arrived at the dead body claim that, after seeing ’his work had succeeded,’ he ran off before the police arrived. His parents could have been responsible as well, but they stayed for a long time, even until the police came. This headline will be mentioned further on Sunday evening, where we will know what truly happened last Sunday.*

Mike looked at it in disgust. There was even a picture of him on the side. He wondered how they got that photograph, how they were allowed to mention his name without being asked. BBC wouldn't even report something like that unless they were sure he was the culprit. He wouldn't let the news on Sunday broadcast. He had to stop it- or lose everybody that loved him.

That night, 6 policemen arrived at Mikey Hiker’s house. One was quite plump, with an unsmiling face. There was a very aged man, he was also unsmiling. Infact, the whole group weren't cheerful at all. There was two women. One of them actually was smiling but the other wasn't. There were two other men. One was very small, the other very skinny. They were here to see if Mikey or his parents were responsible for murder.

Mikey somehow recognised 5 of them. He only didn't recognise the smiling women. Mike thought he was just imagining at first. They were only policemen and women. But he just had an uneasy feeling. Maybe he just hoped that they didn't think he was the culprit. Otherwise he would probably be sent to prison, and would have to try and stop the Sunday morning news, which was impossible, especially for a kid like him.

He and his family were only allowed outside, while the police did their jobs indoors. It was only when Mike was relaxed outside with nothing to think about, a thought crossed his mind. A few years ago, something was announced on the news. It showed that MI6 had found out about a group called Predators, that had been running for decades unnoticed. A few of the members were shown, taken by secret cameras, the same type that had photographed Mikey. 5 of them were identical to the ’police’ Mike had met.

He watched his mum and dad. They were reading peacefully, unaware of the real situation happening right now. Mikey slipped away, out of his deck chair and to the back door. He forgot it was locked. He couldn't even get to the key. The Predators had it. Mike loved spy books but knew he could never be the main character. He sighed a long sigh, then clung onto the drainpipe and pulled himself up.

It was harder than he had imagined. His hands were slipping, and they were strained like heck. He had got nowhere, and now his hands were sore. He wasn't a genius, and had no crazy ideas. He just knew he had to get up there, and fast. And then a lightbulb lit up in Mikey’s brain. He felt mad. It was like he was turning into a superhero. Mike checked if this was a dream by shutting his eyes. Maybe he was still lying in his bed from fainting.

But no, he was awake alright. He had been hoping this was a nightmare. He still had a slither of hope that this was just a very, very, frighteningly realistic dream. He would probably wake up now, just maybe. No, it was just not happening. It was real life. Just a crazy phenomenon happening in his life. Why him? He was bringing himself to the most dangerous people in the world.

Mike got back on track. He had to at least attempt this plan. His drainpipe had always had one loose screw. He yanked it out of the brickwork as quietly as he could. His parents were still sucked inside their books. He used that screw to pluck out others. He pulled on the pipe and a part of it came off, silently to Mike’s pleasure. He hoped that he wouldn't get bellowed at for this.

He had a rope in his dad’s shed. He snuck to the small wooden cabin and snatched up the rope. He then tied it around the end of the pipe. He then wrapped the rope round it like the string on a yo-yo. Mike had always been told that he was a good thrower at school, but never knew it would be this useful. He lobbed the object at the chimney. It made a clang! but Mike realised his parents were now asleep, and hadn't been awoken. The pipe had got stuck around it, but that was the plan. Like a yo-yo again, the string was winding back up. Mike held the rope as it swooped him off his feet and onto the roof.

Chapter 3: The Dead Body in the Wardrobe

Mikey Hiker landed on the roof of his house. He sat, his heart pounding. He realised he had damaged the chimney badly. He had smashed the pot and the brickwork was cracked. He realised now how stupid he had been. Using a homemade grappling hook to fly to the roof of his house, not even sure it would work. He was glad that he hadn't even took a scratch, never mind a lost limb! He used to be a quiet boy, now he was pulling off death defying stunts, only to get to more danger!

Mike also knew that there was no turning back now. If he did turn back, he would’ve risked his life for nothing. Not accepting defeat, Mikey stood. He had no idea that it was a big mistake. The snow had melted on the roofs of the houses and had turned into ice. Mikey slid to the edge of the roof like when he was ice-skating. He was suddenly in the air, falling, but then he reached out and caught the edge of the roof just in time.

Mikey hung on the edge of the roof for dear life. He was amazed- no matter what he did, he was staying alive! And then Mikey heard a faint scream. He realised he was hanging next to his bedroom window and he looked in. The Predators were in there, and they had taken their fake police outfits off to reveal their true identity. They were cornering the lady that was once smiling, but now she was doing the opposite. Mike gasped- Werewolf had a knife...

And they were all talking. Werewolf threatened the lady, “...so don't move. I am skilled with a knife, and it will be in your heart if you attempt anything.”
“Oh, please! I'll do anything for you! Just please don't do it, please!” The policewoman cried.
“Okay. All I want you do is come closer.”
“O-k-k-ay.” She said, already following Werewolf’s orders.
“That's good!” He congratulated. “Now, I would like you to...die.” Werewolf stabbed the sharp silver object into the lady's heart. Not much blood; it was a very clean death. It was also simple as you only needed a knife.

The Predators might have been fine with the death, to them it was as easy as pie. However, Mikey wasn't alright with what had just taken place. He had knew that these people were extremely dangerous, but now he almost felt that ’extremely dangerous’ was an understatement. What on earth had happened to make them this way? It must have been a big thing to make them this horrible.

It was then that they deposited the body into Mikey’s wardrobe, and left. He waited until their voices disappeared, then smashed his window open, and clambered in. He had actually meant it to be quite silent, but it had been fairly loud. He then heard footsteps getting louder, and knew the Predators were coming. His bed had boxes underneath, and there was no space to hide. There was only one place to go.
And that was in the wardrobe.

Without thinking, he opened it and jumped in. It stank in there, and seeing the colourless face in the darkness of the enclosed space scared him terribly. He heard his door open and held his breath. “Do you really believe she survived? You idiot!” Arachnid shouted to Serpent.
“Arak, what else could it be?” Serpent asked.
“Shut up and we'll find out what it is.”

The group searched the room all over. They eventually came to the wardrobe. “It’s got to be in here!” Cheetah assured them all.
So they looked in the wardrobe. They only found the dead body, nobody else. “Come on guys, it's probably nothing. Maybe it's next door.” Scorpion suggested.
“You guys go. I'll stay here for a bit.” Arachnid stated.
“Right.” The 4 others chorused.

Mikey stood behind the body. Arachnid stared into the wardrobe. “If there's nobody there, then this won't hurt.” Arachnid said, before throwing a spear at the dead woman. It went right through her, and hit what would have been Mikey, if he hadn't jumped out of the way at the last second. He wasn't dead, but was now in the open. Mike took the only weapon in range- the knife in the lady. It was a clean death, but with the knife out of the woman it was not. Blood was getting everywhere. 

Mike hadn't thought of the Predators having a weak spot, but it seemed that Arachnid hated blood. Like Mikey, he passed out. Mike thought that he would as well, but he held on. He opened the door to the hallway. That led him to Cheetah. She turned around to see him. “Mikey Hiker. A 12 year old. Your jok-” she laughed, but saw the knife in his hand, and became more serious. “I guess you're not playing childish games anymore, huh. Well you should put that knife down, and go and play. There is a normal world and a world full of spies. You belong in the normal one. So go before I kill you...”

Mikey refused. “You brought me into this new world where everything is horrible. You tried to frame me for no reason! You killed Sam, didn't you!”
“And the lady in the wardrobe.” Cheetah added.
“Your proud of your deaths, but why?” Mike was now furious.
“We'll be proud of your death, for sure.” Said a voice. 
Mike turned round and saw not just one person, but 3. Scorpion, Werewolf and Serpent, and they all had guns.

However, Mike had a plan that beat all the odds of him winning. He ran forward towards Cheetah, fist out. Then there was the spray of bullets. Mikey ducked, and so did Cheetah. She was next to the banister. Mikey threw her over it, and she fell all the stairs and slammed onto her back. And then more bullets. BANG! BOOM! They were aimed at Mikey but they realised that Mikey must have fallen down the stairs with Cheetah. Werewolf peered over the edge. Then, for a split-second, he saw that Mike was holding onto the edge of the banister. Then he was grabbed and pulled down to join Cheetah.

Mikey pulled himself up. He wasn't done. The two others still had guns but they were just staring down the bottom of the stairs. They stood for a long while, but finally looked at Mikey, a 12 year old, who had just bought down some of the worst criminals in the world. They wouldn't let him win though. His serious face and furious eyes just gave them the shivers. They both brought up their guns. Ready...aim...FIRE! They had hit. They had hit the meddling boy! Mikey Hiker was dead. He had got what he deserved. 

They then turned round, and, miraculously, there stood Mikey. The last thing the two saw before being knocked out was a 12 year old’s fist. 
Mike smiled.
It had been so easy! After pulling Werewolf down he had snuck into his mum and dad’s room. Serpent and Scopion had been busy looking down the stairs, he had been able to sneak back to them clutching his mum’s stand-up mirror. He placed it infront of them, but far enough away for them not to see themselves in it. He had stood behind the two, and tried not to smirk when they were dumb enough to fall for his plan.

He was also smiling because he had taken down the whole Predators group single-handedly. He had taken no injuries (except his hands, which ached from hanging above the stairs) and he had done more work than MI5, MI6, the CIA and all other secret spy organisations had done. Without knowing, Mikey had started laughing. He was actually so pleased!

He reckoned the next smart thing to do would be dialling 999. The group would be conscious again soon, and despite how he had taken them down quite easily, he couldn't know he would be able to do it again. They were the most wanted criminals in the world for heaven’s sake! So, he turned and was greeted by the unfriendly face of Arachnid. “Wipe that smile of your face, dumb kid.” He said as he let his foot rocket into his waist. It was too fast of an attack to dodge it.
Mikey Hiker knew what would happen now.

The world was swirling around him, the illusion too good for him to take. The yellow blodge infront of him was Arachnid, staring. Wait...no...was he staring, was he even there? Maybe not...hang on...ARGH! He was flashing millions of colours a second. Then the world was properly spinning out of control. Mike was lost in all the swirls and curls. Then there was the pain as he fell on his back. But the pain wasn't very great, he was to busy thinking. Memories were spilling out of his mind.

He was three years old on the swing in his local park, a nice area not including the ugly graffiti by the teens who occasionally hung around here after school. Luckily for Mikey and his mother, it was school time for the teenagers, so they were free. Mikey had wanted to try the swing. He loved the feeling of soaring in the air. His mum pushed for a bit, but had to rest for a second. In that time, little Mike had climbed onto the older children’s swings. 

He pushed off with his feet, too hard it seemed. One minute he was on the swing, then flying into the air. He knew that gravity was going to pull him back down now. He would fall. Maybe die. Falling, falling. He was going to make contact with the ground too fast. No! This couldn't be happening!
Arachnid just watched the boy on the floor. For Mike, the process of falling unconscious felt like forever. For the Predator watching him, it only took one second for Mikey Hiker to fall, and black out.

Chapter 4: BBC Breakout

Mikey opened his eyes. It didn't make much difference if he did or didn't have his eyes closed; he couldn't see anything either way. In fact, was he even awake? He attempted to put his hands on his eyes, but he lost energy trying to free them from some sort of metal handcuffs. “He's awake,” someone muttered.
“Take that off of his head, Scorp.” Came an order from the grumbly voice of Arachnid.
“Who says you lead now?” Scorpion challenged.
“You lost a fight to a twelve-year-old. Now do it!”

The sack that had blocked Mikey’s vision was lifted off his head. Mikey could now see that he was cuffed to a chair, and he was in some sort of interrogation room. It was a small room, empty if you were not including the chair. And Mikey, Scorpion and Arachnid were there of course. The room was painted an intimidating blood red, the door old and creaking as Mikey realised when Scorpion wandered through and shut it behind him.
That left Mike and Arachnid.
Alone.

He was sat, tied up, terribly vulnerable and to add to it, a proffesional killer was standing in front of him wanting revenge.
He was dead meat.
That was something he could say truthfully.
He was now, although he never had done, praying. Well, doing the best he could with his hands handcuffed. He muttered some goodbyes to close friends, family. He then swiftly changed from a plea to God to saying some of the rudest words he knew.

This seemed to amuse Arachnid. “Honestly, I feel like I'm front row seats at a jerk contest. Just know something- you would honestly win 1st prize. Here's your reward; a kick to the ankle.”
“Argh!” Mikey yelled out in pain. He was falling of the chair. Wait...no...falling with the chair. And the weight of it was making his hands rub into his handcuffs. Then the pain subsided, but only after the chair was brought down onto him, which broke and also probably broke some of Mikey’s bones.

Mike found it hard to stand, because his hands were stuck together and he had almost broke his back. But he managed it, eventually. He kept a solid face —he knew he must show no fear to Arachnid— but inside he was yelling, crying, furious. He had no tolerance for these messed up  and people. He wanted to shut them all in a mental asylum and never let them see the light of day again. Just the thought of ways to dispose of the Predators wiped his anger away.

But definitely not all anger was washed away. Mike would never forget the evil doings of the Predators. He would get his revenge- if he lived of course. 
And that question stuck in his mind.
Would he survive?
Would he be locked up maybe?
Those were questions that would probably be answered soon. Mike was snapped back into the world again when Arachnid started talking. “Let the torturing begin!” Exclaimed a happy Arachnid. He sick man couldn't wait to torture a twelve-year-old.

“Shut up! Stop! Please help!” Mikey desperately shouted as he was dragged out of the creaky door and into some corridors. Some men that looked terrified were painting the walls the same blood colour as the other room. Mike held back the sick- these colours reminded him of the remains of Sam Brookfield and the unfortunate policewoman that —he remembered— was still in his wardrobe. Wouldn't his parents found he was missing? And seen the atrocity in his bedroom?

****************************************************

Andy and Jane Hiker couldn't enter their house. They knew what they had to do. It was their last thought, but the only one that would work. “Here goes nothing,” Jane mumbled, picking up the brick and throwing it towards the window. It wasn't double-glazing, so the brick ploughed through it with ease. It was an ear shattering sound though, and Jane and Andy felt deaf for a second. Once the effect had drifted off, they clambered through the window cautiously avoiding the knife-sharp edges.

The place was a wreck. They suspicions about the police had come to a conclusion. They were definitely not police. 
But if not police then who were they? 
Why were they here?
Why them?
They carried on trudging through the dump. Their beautiful cottage was a tip. As they walked towards the stairs they became more disgusted with what the ’police’ had done. Jane lead Andy up the stairs. She held the banister.
And fell backwards.

She fell down the few steps they had ascended and lay on the floor, in some sort of sleep. Andy rushed down to his wife. She was out cold. Now he saw the needle on the banister. She had been drugged with some sort of sleeping pill. He ran to the front door. He could rush to the police station on their road. He found the key sitting on the floor. He took it and unlocked the door. He pulled the handle.
He didn’t see what was on it.

Some time passed before Serpent and Werewolf —who was mostly alright still after being thrown down the stairs— arrived and stuffed Mikey Hiker’s parents into a van. Serpent drove because of Werewolf’s dislocated arm he had been awarded from Mikey. They got ready for the long drive to the ferry, and after the sail they would drive through France’s icy roads to the ski resort named Morzine.

                           
Mikey was pushed into the cell. It had been recently made, he was probably the first prisoner in there. He was almost happy about that; if the Predators just left people here to die it would reek of dead bodies. The smell hadn’t been nice in his wardrobe. Mike heard the rattling of wheels and Arachnid appeared with a man pushing a trolley with medieval torture devices on it. He recognised most of them from history lessons. 

He saw the rack.
He saw the pliers. 
He saw a hammer.
He saw duck tape.
And he saw lots of spikes.
Which one would kill him? His spine shuddered as he looked at the tips of the spikes. So sharp. Patiently frozen waiting for someone to impale. Mikey would be sick this time. A minute later there was a greeny-pink slop of last night's dinner spread all over the floor.

After Arachnid and the other man had finished their brief chat, Arachnid left. That was only after he had punched Mikey a couple times, though. When there was no noise from Arachnid’s footsteps, the man who Mike thought would slowly kill him introduced himself swiftly.

“My name’s Bill. I wouldn't kill a boy of...what age are you? Nine?”
“Twelve,” Mike corrected.
“Let's go,” Bill said, ignoring Mikey’s response entirely.
Bill opened the prison door and Mike followed unsurely. This had to be a trap. But if it was a trap, there was no sign of it so far. Bill opened a window and helped Mikey through it. They now stood on the roof. “BBC headquarters. Why would the Predators invade here?” Bill asked, not hoping for an answer.
“This is BBC headquarters?”
“Yep. Actually quite a good view of Sunday's dawn.”
Then Mike’s eyes widened.
Sunday morning.
When the BBC news would broadcast

“Come on,” Bill whispered, “they'll get us if we don't hurry. Hey! Wait!”
“I need to go. Now.” Mikey said, already struggling into the window.
“But I was saving you! I was...sorry, I have to go.” And with that, the two went separate ways.

It was only when Mikey had entered the stolen BBC headquarters a loudspeaker screamed. SUIT UP. THERE HAS BEEN A BBC BREAKOUT! Mikey stayed in the janitor’s closet (that was where you entered after climbing through the window, funnily enough) as footsteps trotted by. There was Arachnid’s angry voice, but Mikey realised —with a smirk— that there was a slight ’I've been beaten by a twelve-year-old’ hint in his voice. 

“How did he escape?” His voice said, showing no sign of hiding the exasperation in his tone.
A short but menacing man answered, “We believe that the man who was supposed to be torturing Mikey saved him.”
“What!” Arachnid shouted without containing his anger. When he got his hands on this filthy little...ARGH! Arachnid turned around and pulled out a gun. A loud BANG followed by a scream and the small man fell backwards. Arachnid muttered, “I feel better now.” And exited through the door.
